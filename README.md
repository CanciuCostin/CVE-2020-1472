# CVE-2020-1472

CVE-2020-1472 - Zero Logon vulnerability Python implementation

## Description
* A Python script which uses the Impacket library to test for CVE-2020-1472 (Zerologon vulnerability)
* It attempts to perform Netlogon authentication bypass. The script will terminate when succesfully 
performing the bypass.
* When a domain controller is patched, the script will stop after sending 2000 pairs of RPC calls (target is not vulnerable with a false negative chance of 0.04%).
* Note that by default this changes the password of the domain controller account. This allows to DCSync, but it also breaks communication with other DCs.
* More info and original research [here](https://www.secura.com/blog/zero-logon)

## Prerequisites

```
pip install impacket
```
or Download the impacket release [here](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/releases). Unpack it, and in the directory where you placed it, run:
```
pip install .
```

## Usage

Given a domain controller named `DC-NAME` with IP address `X.X.X.X`, run the script as follows:

    ./zerologon_tester.py DC-NAME X.X.X.X

The DC name is the NetBIOS computer name. If this name is not correct, the script will fail with a 
`STATUS_INVALID_COMPUTER_NAME` error.
